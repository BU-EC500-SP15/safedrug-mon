Currently, I am in the process of just learning how to use Scala on the IntelliJ IDEA. I have never used the Scala programming language before so I need to devote some time to understand and learn how to use it proficiently. I have also never used the IntelliJ IDEA before, so I will need to understand how to use it as well. Once I feel like I have a better grasps of how to use Scala, and have an idea of the actual project requirements,  I will see where I can proceed from there and begin working in depth with Apache Spark.
