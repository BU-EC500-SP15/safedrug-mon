*In depth SBT And SparkStreaming + Scala Primer*

- The above URL should be *actively* watched, it might take someone a day or more to really grasp all the concepts (intellij, scala, sbt, etc), and assumes that the watcher will google around for individual concepts and play with them.  
- It also assumes basic working knowledge of the linux terminal, using commands like ls, grep and so on.

- And of course, some understanding of java.


In any case, that video can provide a good giudepost  .  Once you understand the concepts in it and can reproduce it, you are really ready to start hacking on the spark streaming twitter application.
